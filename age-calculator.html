        <h3>What is Chronological Age?</h3>
        <p>Chronological age refers to the actual amount of time a person has been alive, measured from their date of birth to a specific date. It's the most common and universally understood method of quantifying age. Unlike biological or psychological age, which can vary based on health and mental state, chronological age is a fixed, objective measure. Our tool calculates your precise chronological age, providing a clear and exact numerical representation of your journey through time.</p>

        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h3>
        <div class="faq-section">

                <p>Our age calculator determines the time elapsed from your exact date of birth to the current date.
